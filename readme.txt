== Installation ==
	
 * Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
 * Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
 
 == Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want the user to upload a file once payment has been made rather than during the checkout process? =

If you allowed every user to upload a file without yet making a payment then every time a payment failed or you used a payment method that waits for an IPN response, your disk space will be consumed by files you should not have received. By waiting until after payment this keeps things cleaner.

= Where are files stored? =

Uploaded files are stored in your wp-content/uploads folder, a new folder named "wc-pay-to-upload" will be created and within that each order will have it's own folder based on the order ID.

= How do I access the uploaded files? =

Once files are uploaded you can view them from the admin view of the order. A meta box is added to the side with links to the files.
